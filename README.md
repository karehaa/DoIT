# to_do_app

A new Flutter project, aimed for my self-growth and deepen my understanding about flutter programming language itself.

## Why do this?

i do this mainly because i want to improve my programming skill by actually practicing what i have learnt so far with flutter.

# Feature Analysis
- Calendar
- Lists (user input for to do lists)
- Lists connected to time and Calendar
- Lists strike-through when finished
- Show progress for each day/week/month/year (Percentage of daily/weekly/monthly/annually completion)
- Collaboration (optional)

## 11/11/2024 Progress
Improving the UI design before turning it into codes. The design concept i am interested in is:
- Simple
- Minimalist
- Not many colors
- Beginner Friendly

As for the name of the app, i think sticking with "Do!T" is good already, that name is quite catchy and very self-explanatory.
