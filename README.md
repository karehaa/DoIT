# to_do_app

A new Flutter project, aimed for my self-growth and deepen my understanding about flutter programming language itself.

## Why do this?

i do this mainly because i want to improve my programming skill by actually practicing what i have learnt so far with flutter.

# Feature Analysis
- Calendar
- Lists (user input for to do lists)
- Lists connected to time and Calendar
- Lists strike-through when finished
- Show progress for each day/week/month/year (Percentage of daily/weekly/monthly/annually completion)
- Collaboration (optional)

Improving the UI design before turning it into codes. The design concept i am interested in is:
- Simple
- Minimalist
- Not many colors
- Beginner Friendly

As for the name of the app, i think sticking with "Do!T" is good already, that name is quite catchy and very self-explanatory.

Skipped 2 days due to the many assignments on campus, but finally i have time to work on this again.
I have been thinking of something to do about this, but i guess my priority is to finish the UI design first.

I might make it real simple, for as long as it is functional, my objectives here is to learn to apply my knowledge on flutter,
so i think i should make this project functional while keeping it realistic to do.

While i do still want to retain all the Feature i wrote previously, i think i might remove some on the process of making this if it gets overly hard
Though i might still consider to YOLO through the hardships cuz that is what make me improve.

So this is the docomentary for this whole project. Hopefully it will be something i can be proud of.

Still working on the UI design, im getting somewhere and have a vague idea of how i want it to look like.

I just need to make this design able to handle all the feature that i want to create, somehow. lol.

## 16/11/2024 Progress
I finished the design, not the whole, but the initial design. I still have a lot more to go, but this is finally time where i can start.

I will start implementing the design into codes, but for today i guess i will just change the background color, lol.

But if later i feel that i want to do more, then i will do more.

Extra: On a whim, i tried to use kanata to remap my capslock key to a mod-tap of esc and lctrl key, was quite fun actually, lol, that's just it.

Another Extra: felt like i want to do more, so i coded a little bit of the UI, still need to figure out on how to make it actually scrollable, so still a long way to go i guess.

## 17/11/2024 Progress
I guess today is somewhat a rest day, lol. i needed some rest. But from my research i know that to make this scrollable there is something that i need to understand.

That is about GestureDetector or whatever it is called, i need to also combine it with some animation i guess? i don't know.

For now i have no idea on how to implement it, but well, imma make it happen, for now today progression i guess i will just move the Stack widget to a separate .dart Friendly

cuz if i guess correctly, i will be needing a Stateful class to make this scrolling thingy happen.

## 18/11/2024 Progress
Added a small draggable scroll indicator at the top of the todo page. i have been seeing and trying to understand the concept of GestureDetector and how i can implement it, but well, kinda complicated. But i think this one is that one concept where if you get the catch once, you will be able to understand it and implement it however you want, i just need to get myself together and try to understand this GestureDetector thingy, all i know now is that for my feature to work i will be need onVerticalDragUpdate and some animation? i don't know, i will try to understand it more.
