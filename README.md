# to_do_app

A new Flutter project, aimed for my self-growth and deepen my understanding about flutter programming language itself.

## Why do this?

i do this mainly because i want to improve my programming skill by actually practicing what i have learnt so far with flutter.

# Feature Analysis
- Calendar
- Lists (user input for to do lists)
- Lists connected to time and Calendar
- Lists strike-through when finished
- Show progress for each day/week/month/year (Percentage of daily/weekly/monthly/annually completion)
- Collaboration (optional)

## 11/11/2024 Progress
Improving the UI design before turning it into codes. The design concept i am interested in is:
- Simple
- Minimalist
- Not many colors
- Beginner Friendly

As for the name of the app, i think sticking with "Do!T" is good already, that name is quite catchy and very self-explanatory.

## 14/11/2024 Progress
Skipped 2 days due to the many assignments on campus, but finally i have time to work on this again.
I have been thinking of something to do about this, but i guess my priority is to finish the UI design first.

I might make it real simple, for as long as it is functional, my objectives here is to learn to apply my knowledge on flutter,
so i think i should make this project functional while keeping it realistic to do.

While i do still want to retain all the Feature i wrote previously, i think i might remove some on the process of making this if it gets overly hard
Though i might still consider to YOLO through the hardships cuz that is what make me improve.

So this is the docomentary for this whole project. Hopefully it will be something i can be proud of.

## 15/11/2024 Progress
Still working on the UI design, im getting somewhere and have a vague idea of how i want it to look like.

I just need to make this design able to handle all the feature that i want to create, somehow. lol.

## 16/11/2024 Progress
I finished the design, not the whole, but the initial design. I still have a lot more to go, but this is finally time where i can start.

I will start implementing the design into codes, but for today i guess i will just change the background color, lol.

But if later i feel that i want to do more, then i will do more.

Extra: On a whim, i tried to use kanata to remap my capslock key to a mod-tap of esc and lctrl key, was quite fun actually, lol, that's just it.

Another Extra: felt like i want to do more, so i coded a little bit of the UI, still need to figure out on how to make it actually scrollable, so still a long way to go i guess.

## 17/11/2024 Progress
I guess today is somewhat a rest day, lol. i needed some rest. But from my research i know that to make this scrollable there is something that i need to understand.

That is about GestureDetector or whatever it is called, i need to also combine it with some animation i guess? i don't know.

For now i have no idea on how to implement it, but well, imma make it happen, for now today progression i guess i will just move the Stack widget to a separate .dart Friendly

cuz if i guess correctly, i will be needing a Stateful class to make this scrolling thingy happen.

## 18/11/2024 Progress
Added a small draggable scroll indicator at the top of the todo page. i have been seeing and trying to understand the concept of GestureDetector and how i can implement it, but well, kinda complicated. But i think this is that one concept where if you get the catch once, you will be able to understand it and implement it however you want, i just need to get myself together and try to understand this GestureDetector thingy, all i know now is that for my feature to work i will be need onVerticalDragUpdate and some animation? i don't know, i will try to understand it more.

## 19/11/2024
Finally able to understand the GestureDetector and make the todo page scrollable! so happy, big progress for me. Loving this project so far. Next probably before i go to the actual contents, i will try and make the animation a bit more smoother if possible, and just kinda optimize things that can be optimized.

## 20/11/2024
Nothing much, just small optimization.

## 21/11/2024
BIG OPTIMIZATION! im loving today's improvement on the UI/UX, the animation is smoother and i have managed to make it more optimized by utilizing vsync and .dispose() method, it is overall quite confusing, and i still need to understand more about a few parts, but overall i gained so much knowledge by doing this! Today is a big improvements! im enjoying and falling deeper and deeper in the enjoyment of programming (well, gotta love the errors that comes with it too, lol.)

## 22/11/2024
There is really nothing that changed, it is been a busy day that i can not really put on any work. I just changed the regular Text widget with TextField.

## 23/11/2024
Today, i don't really immediately go into putting more feature, i am just doing some research as to what i can use to make the pop-up window for the user to put their to-do lists, i wanted it so that what the user typed will be converted into a checkbox lists, and so after some research i think the thing that i needed to understand next is FloatinActiongButton and AlertDialog, i will try to understand this widget first, only after that will i start implementing this into my project.

## 24/11/2024
Didn't do much, i was getting sidetracked and leanrt dart itself, lol. It is very similar with Java (language that i use for my college), so it is a bit interesting, and kinda get my attention a bit, lmao. But well, im still cool with new knowledge you know? the thing about learning is that you will always find a new and interesting stuff to leanr and understand, and the best way to learn is to enjoy what you learn and the whole process, so yeah (i am absolutely not defending myself from sidetracking rn).

## 27/11/2024
Yep, kinda skipped a few days, lately im quite busy with preparing for my final semester test, so i don't really have much time to spend on this project, but i will try to make sure from now on to at least try and spend some small portion of my time toward this project even if im busy.

## 28/11/2024
PROJECT WILL BE ON HOLD. As my final exams is only 1 week away, i need to focus more on my study as i do not want any fall on my academic life. So this project will be on hold until my exam days are over, best of luck to me.
